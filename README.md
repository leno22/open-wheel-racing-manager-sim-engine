# Open Wheel Racing Manager — Simulation Engine

A **data-driven simulation engine prototype** for an open-wheel motorsport management game.
This repository focuses on **season simulation**, **standings**, **points rules**, and **future expansion** (sponsors, R&D, regulations, AI-generated narratives).
